Since January 1983, Frontline has served as American public television's - PBS - flagship public affairs series. Hailed upon its television broadcast debut as "the last best hope for broadcast documentaries," FRONTLINE's stature over 20 seasons is reaffirmed each week through incisive documentaries covering the scope and complexity of the human experience.

Since its inception, Frontline has never shied away from tough, controversial issues or complex stories. Frontline remains committed to providing a primetime venue for engaging documentaries that fully explore and illuminate the critical issues of our times.

Frontline remains the only regularly scheduled long-form public-affairs documentary series on American television, producing more hours of documentary programming than all the commercial networks combined./description

Search for you artist/band and get the songs on youtube of their albums. 

Databases used - 
Musicbrainz.org : artist search, artist albums + tracks list and youtube channel of artist.
Last.fm : similair artist and artist image + description and last.fm top tracks.
Freebase.com : album description.
Fanart.tv : album image.

Note : It will occasionally/often find wrong videos of the song on youtube. Simply because there in no video of that song on youtube or the search find the wrong video we would want or the video is regional blocked on youtube. But mostly if you search for the popular and latest albums. The results are better./description
