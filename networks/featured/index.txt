Search for you artist/band and get the songs on youtube of their albums. 

Databases used - 
Musicbrainz.org : artist search, artist albums + tracks list and youtube channel of artist.
Last.fm : similair artist and artist image + description and last.fm top tracks.
Freebase.com : album description.
Fanart.tv : album image.

Note : It will occasionally/often find wrong videos of the song on youtube. Simply because there in no video of that song on youtube or the search find the wrong video we would want or the video is regional blocked on youtube. But mostly if you search for the popular and latest albums. The results are better./description
