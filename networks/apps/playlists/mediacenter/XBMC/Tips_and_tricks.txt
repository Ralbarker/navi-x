Downloading Navi-X :
You will find the latest version of Navi-X.
When using Navi-X go to Navi-X Home or go to the website www.Navi-X.org

Recommendation use of Navi-X:
At this time (3 august 2010) you probably should use Navi-X with on of the latest XBMC builds. However with every change on Navi-X or XBMC it can effect which XBMC build you should use. Preferable to use the script and not plugin, because this isn't updated in a while.
