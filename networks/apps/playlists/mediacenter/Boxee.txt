description=1.0 release of Navi-X on Boxee. Thanks to Jimqode and Frank. No need to report any feauture requests. At the moment the goal for Navi-X Boxee was simply to get all the media to play.  Not to port abilities of XBMC Navi-X script to Boxee Navi-X app. Because at the moment the Boxee API lacks some functions, that will make this much easier to do. No estimated release time of an update (as far as I know). If anyone else is interested to help update the app. Tell this on navix.turner3d.net or on Boxee forums. If there is an update you will probably read it on Navi_X twitter or on Boxee forums./description
